# cricketjs

Javascript program that takes cricket scorer data and uses it for an animation.  

Hand-coded without extensive use of libraries.  The workflow involved taking data input into a custom Excel cricket-scoring spreadsheet, extracted and converted to an csv file.  

This process is now superseded by the mobile cricket scorer app, that prepares suitable csv files with richer data input.
